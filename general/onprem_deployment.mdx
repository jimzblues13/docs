With Genesist On-Prem, you can deploy our advanced enterprise AI platform directly within your private cloud or physical server. Whether it's on a cloud provider of your choice, in any geographic location, or running on your GPUs, Genesist On-Prem integrates seamlessly into your existing environment.

By choosing On-Prem, you ensure that your data, including any documents, files, or databases connected to Genesist, remains securely within your own cloud. None of your data is transmitted through Genesist’s servers. This is particularly crucial if you're handling sensitive information such as health, financial, or legal data, and need to adhere to strict data privacy requirements.

While your deployment does regularly send performance and usage metrics to Genesist’s cloud for the purpose of optimizing GPU resources and billing, all network traffic from your device is meticulously logged. This audit trail allows your engineering or security teams to monitor and review the device's activities continuously.

### Prerequisites :
You’ll be promptly connected with a Genesist Account Representative who will assist you every step of the way, from proof-of-concept to full production deployment.

Our  Account Representative will guide you through the process of setting up:
- A Genesist product contract
- A Genesist Console account. Your contract will be associated with a specific Genesist project, and you can manage your usage, credentials, billing, and more in the Genesist Console.

Before your planned on-prem deployment, your Genesist Account Representative will need:
- Your Genesist  account email address
- Your Genesist Company ID

Providing this information will enable Genesist to authorize your project for on-prem usage, including access to container images and download links for AI models.

For detailed troubleshooting and on-demand support, an ongoing support contract with Genesist is required.
