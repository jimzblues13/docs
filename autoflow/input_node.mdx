With the Input node, you can:
- Send instruction to any part of the system 
- Allow your users to send messages to those same parts

Why the Input node as a prompt is important?
1. Helps AI understand what you need.
2. Handles different types of data easily.
3. Lets users influence outcomes.
4. Connects smoothly with other parts of the system.
5. Customizes user experiences.
6. Works well with large data sets.
7. Adapts to changes and expansions.

Here are a few quick facts:
- Inputs can be text fields of any length and are sent to the connected node.
- Even though inputs can be long, remember that LLMs have limits on input size.
