Follow these steps to start building your dashboard:
- **Define Your Dashboard**, Initiate the creation of a new dashboard by specifying a title, description, and the type of dashboard (e.g., Dashboard or Report) you wish to create.

<img
  className="hidden dark:block"
  src="/images/dashboard_create1.png"
  alt="Hero Dark"
/>

- **Add Charts and Notes**, Incorporate various types of blocks, such as charts, markdown for narrative, and links for external resources. Click the Chart button you’ve created or use the updated chart features for enhanced visualization options.
